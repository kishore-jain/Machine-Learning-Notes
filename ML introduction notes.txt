what is MACHINE LEARNING ?
1 its part of data science
2 ML means machine is learning Something usefull from the data given by the user at run time


something usefull :
	 data(raw facts collection)
	data pattern
	hidden data pattern
	past experience ( situational thinking)
	generalization


DEEP LEARNING 
	dl is a subset of ML

Info ( processed data)
insights(through  understanding of INFO)

MACHINE LEARNING GOALS:
		
		ITS PROVIDES GENERALISED DATA MODEL ( OPTED MODEL WITH ACCEPTED OUTPUT)
		
		FIND OUT THE HIDDEN DATA PATTERN BEHIND EVERY SINGLE DATA SET

		SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF MACHINE ALSO CALLED CONCURRENT EXECUTION OF DATA
		
		IT AVOIDS OVERFITTING OF DATA & UNDERFITTING OF DATA 
		1 OVERFITTING - LOW BAIS (PRACTICAL TRAINING TIME ERROR) AND HIGHT VARIANCE ( TESTET TIMING ERROR)
		2 UNDERFITTING - HIGH BAIS AND HIGH VARIANCE

		MINIMUM ACCURACY OF 73% SHOULD BE MAINTAINED
		
		MACHINE INPUT MUST BE (2D) FORMAT 

		MACHINE GIVES USUALLY HIGH LEVEL PRIORITY TO NUMERICAL VALUES (NUMBER)

MODULE 1 ( DATA SCIENCE INTRO , PANDAS , NUMPY , SCIPY, MATPLOTLIB,SEABORN)
1 PANDAS -- DATA ANALYSIS LIBRARY

2 NUMPY -- NUMERICAL METHOD ARRAY PROCESSING PACKAGE

   1D ARRAY -- CONTAINS LENGTH ( SCALAR VALUE )
   2D ARRAY -- CALLED AS TABLE 

3 SCIPY -- HELPS TO DISTRIBUTE DATA - STATISTICS BASED 

4 MATPLOTLIB -- USED FOR BARCHART & PIECHART

5 SEABORN -- ADVANCE OF MATPLOTLIB

MODULE 2 
    ( ML . ALGORITHMS,SCIKIT LEARNS ALSO KNOWN AS SKLEARN ,  PYLAB)

MODULE 3
	(COMBINING M1 & M2 USING SOME DATA SET PROJECTS)

10 ALGORITHMS :
	1 Linear REGRESSION(S)-(y=mx+b)-(regression line-y intercept-loss-reduced-residual analysis)
	2 Logistic REGRESSION(S)-(y=mx+b)-Sigmoid functions(1/1+e-z)-(0,1)(Classification algm)
	3 Naive Bayes Algorithms(s)-(bayes thorem)-Probability(classification algm)
	4 Pricipal component Analysis(PCA-Unsupervised)-(dimensionality reduction-Variance-(Co-variance)-(Co-variance matrix))
	5 Support Vector Machine (SVM)-(face recognition-hyperplane,Margin,Marginal distance)-(Classification algm)
	6 KNN(s)-distance calculation-("euclidean- Manhattan-minkowski)-(Classification algm)
	7 KMC(unsupervised)-("euclidean- Manhattan-minkowski)-( centroid calculation- updating centroids)
	8 Decision tree(s)-(gini index, entropy,purity of data split)-(Classification/regression algm)
	9 Random forest (Ensemble Learning - bagging)-(collection of DT)
	10 XGboost (EL-Boosting-framework)-bagging & boosting


DATA SCIENCE : ( Analysis + Analytics)
		analysis = suggestion = what i have done with the data so far 
		analytics = recommendation = what i supposed to do near future
		DL= deep learning
		MNL=Manifold learning(maps)
		TL = transfer learning
		NLP = natral language process(voice recogonisation process)
		AI = artifical intelligence( working culture of modern era)

 DA = [ analysis + analytics(adv analysis) + ML + DL + MNL + TL + NLP + AI ]


BASIC TERMINOLOGY
1 DATA SCIENTIST:
	analytical data professional with high degree of techinical exposure in python

	helps business by collect data, compelling data, interpret data format,modelling data , manipulating data
	
2 DATA SET:
	
	collection of data that is specifically structured one here, specific means similar type of data

	local terms , data set means data grouping

	here, collected data may be small, larger or complex 
3 DATA MINING:
	( we need to segrigate the data by using the same dataset)
	
	finding the Useable model and insights from the dataset 

	it is possible to use many techniques like regression, classification,cluster analysis,outlier(loss/deviation) analysis

4 DATA VISUALISATION:

	Big data should be saved in H5PY,HDF5
	Pictorial representation of visualised content
	display statistical data in a visual fastion
	chart(bar,pie,scatter,heatmap,3d,bubble)
	graph/info graph/tree

5 DATA MODELLING (Action plan / implimentation scheme)
	prototyping of data (prototype means overall systametic design)
	converting a data into a predective/action plan also support visual documents

6 DATA WRANGLING
	 process of formatting or restructuring (raw data into suitable specific data)
	 improve better decision making
	 
7 algorithms
	series and repeatable steps/programs / routines
	expressed in a mathematic fashion using statics data

8 Artificial intelligence
	simulation of human process by the machine
	information acquisation
	information rule creation
	info reasoning(to reach max approximation)
	definite conclusion(Fizzy logic)
	self-correction
